    "ureaIntroductionText": "Our urea is one of the most concentrated nitrogen fertilizers (46%) and is usually marketed in prill or granule form. The former is used for fertigation, while the latter is applied directly to the soil. It is highly soluble and is often used in liquid formulations. Due to its high solubility, it is popular for injection into drip irrigation systems. It is classified as an ammonium source and therefore has a tendency to acidify the soil.",
    "ureaContextText": "The use of urea began in 1935 but became widespread from the 1960s onwards. It can be classified as a fertilizer of organic origin since its chemical structure corresponds to a carbamide compound. It is produced from ammonium and carbon dioxide under high pressure and temperature.",
    "ureaGranulesText": "If the manufacturing process is overheated, this can lead to the formation of unwanted biuret, which can be toxic to some plant species such as citrus fruits. Urea with a biuret content of more than 1%, applied via foliar application, leads to toxicity. This effect is particularly important when urea is used as a foliar fertilizer for flower thinning in grapes.",
    "ureaSoilPHText": "The optimal pH for urease activity lies between 6.5 and 7.0. The hydrolysis rate of urea is five times higher at a pH of 6.0 compared to pH 4.0, as measured in CaCl2. In sandy soil, the complete hydrolysis of urea can take up to 30 days, compared to a maximum of 14 days in clayey soils. The hydrolysis rate decreases with higher urea doses and the pH of the soil. The initial pH of the soil affects the nitrification rate of urea nitrogen. In a soil with a pH of 6.4, measured in CaCl2, all the nitrogen is converted to nitrate within 10 days. In more acidic soils with a pH of 4.2, measured in CaCl2, 25% of the original nitrogen concentration remained after 28 days from application.",
    "ureaOptimalTemperatureText": "It has been found that the optimal temperature for nitrification is between 25°C and 35°C. Under cool conditions, as can occur in moist and poorly drained soils, nitrification proceeds slowly, and there can be a large accumulation of nitrites. These nitrites can be toxic to plant roots at high concentrations. During the hydrolysis phase of urea, there is initially an increase in soil pH (alkalization) and subsequently an acidification. These pH variations can have negative effects on cation nutrient supply.",
